# Contributing Guideline for the Example-Project
I appreciate every help for this project, so everyone is welcomed for contributions. There are multiple ways on how you
can send your contributions.

## Sending an export file
You can send me an export file with the changes you've done either by creating a
[Ticket](https://gitlab.com/martin1522/custom-system-builder-example/-/issues) or via the
[FoundryVTT Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) ([Official CSB Channel](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1037072885044477962)). Your export can either contain only the changed or all
templates.

## Creating a Merge Request
You can also directly upload the Compendium and create a Merge Request from your forked Repository. In this case, I
might request changes to be made. Once each topic is resolved, the MR will be merged with the main-branch.
