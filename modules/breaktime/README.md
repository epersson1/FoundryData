# Break Time
Foundry VTT module to show when players have returned from a break or to display when a player is stepping out for a second.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
To open the away screen hold down the Shift and Home key to open the Breaktime window.  Each player should see the dialog screen and can press the button at the bottom to register when they're back from they're break.

The Shift/Home key combination can be changed in the settings if you'd prefer a different combination.
By default Breaktime can pause and unpause the game when the dialog is opened.

Players can also show when they've stepped away for a second by pressing the door icon on the token menu.  This will send a message to the chat window (if a message has been filled in) and display the player with an empty dot and a door beside their name.

## Library: Chat Commands
BreakTime also supports the Chat Commands Library. /brb and /back are registered commands and can be used to step away return to the game, respectively.
